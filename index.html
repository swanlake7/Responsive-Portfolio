<!-- ### Assignment Two Instructions - (No Bootstrap)

1. Copy the contents of `Basic-Portfolio` (your first homework solution) and paste the mentioned files into `Responsive-Portfolio`.

2. Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g. .git, .gitignore) from the `Basic-Portfolio` repo.

3. If you chose the `Wireframe` exercise for your first homework assignment, talk to a TA, who will provide you with a template for your portfolio.

4. Inside your `Responsive-Portfolio` folder, find your `styles.css` file. You will write your media queries at the bottom of `styles.css`.

5. Use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

   * You use `980px` because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, you want the media queries to kick in before your content gets cut off.

   * `768px` is about the width of a tablet and `640px` is about the width of a phone in landscape.

6. Make the layout match the following screenshots:

   * `index.html`: [980px](Images/980-index.jpg), [768px](Images/768-index.jpg), [640px](Images/640-index.jpg)

   * `portfolio.html`: [980px](Images/980-portfolio.jpg), [768px](Images/768-portfolio.jpg), [640px](Images/640-portfolio.jpg)

   * `contact.html`: [980px](Images/980-contact.jpg), [768px](Images/768-contact.jpg), [640px](Images/640-contact.jpg)

7. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; you don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of your site.

8. Be sure to include the `viewport` tag in all your HTML files, otherwise your media-queries won't function as expected on mobile devices. _(Hint: You won't need to use exact pixels for anything other than the container)_

9. **Protip**: Use the Chrome extensions [Window Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) and [Browser Width](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh) to see the browser dimensions in Chrome.

10. Deploy your new portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages.

### Submitting Your Work on [BootCampSpot](https://www.bootcampspot-v2.com/)

1. Submit the GitHub links to your portfolio repositories on GitHub.

2. Submit the link to your (GitHub Pages) deployed site in the same input field.

### BONUS

* Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

      <p>Welcome to my portfolio!
          This is a space where I introduce myself to potential collaborators, employers, and anyone who wants to connect about coding.

          For the last few years I calculated quantum numbers, synthesized chemicals, TAed, and took classes like physical chemistry.
          After a while I realized that among my diverse interests, coding is the common demonator. So I started the Georgia Tech Full Stack Bootcamp in 2019.</p>
      
      
         <p><em> Random Fact 1</em> - I'm an Atlanta Peach! The city always felt like my home even though I lived abroad when I was younger.</p>
          

          <p><em> RF 2</em> - I always think about designs and am sporatically sketching in my dark room. </p>
          

         <p> <em>RF 3 </em>- In a few years, I want to work on cybersecurity, brain-computer interface, and blockchain.</p>
